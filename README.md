### Send display a list of NPR headlines

- Preferred method: consume this json via network request
  from [https://legacy.npr.org/assets/api/listening-api-response.json](https://legacy.npr.org/assets/api/listening-api-response.json)
- Alternatively, consume the attached file locally. It contains the same json that representing an
  array of **items**, which represent a list of **headlines**. Consume the json and display a list
  of **headlines**.
- Each **headline** should display the title field from the json with an optional **image**. If the
  image exists for a **headline**, it will be the **square rel** from the **image** array inside the
  **links** object
- Each _headlineâ€™s uid_ field is distinct

### Bonus points

Implement clicking a **headline** to open a new view which loads the url into a **WebView**. The url
to load is the first href inside the **web** link array inside the **links** object.
